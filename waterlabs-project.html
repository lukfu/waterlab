                        WaterLab v.1 is a device that measures the concentration of specific types of microparticles in water. The particle type is defined or specified by the apparent radius of the microparticle. When measuring, you can focus on a specific radius, e.g, ~1.0 <span>&#181;</span>m, a specified range, or the complete range that the device is able to cover, approximately 0.03~50 <span>&#181;</span>m. The device is capable of "nomincally" measuring up to radii of 100 <span>&#181;</span>m

                    <p>
                      The WaterLab v.1 device has two versions:
                      <ul>
                        <li>WaterLab v1.0 for USB connectivity, for lab or office operation.</li>
                        <li>Waterlab v.1.1, shown in the photo below, 4 <span>&#10005;</span> 5.5 <span>&#10005;</span> 8 cm<sup>3</sup>, has an IP-classification nr IP68. It is waterproof when submerged under water for longer periods of time (the highest classification is IP69: can be exposed to high-pressure heated water from various angles), and has a Lora/GSM card for networking.</li>
