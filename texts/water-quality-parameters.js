    Water quality is quantified by measuring physical, chemical, and biological indicators, often using standardized tests and sensors
    <ul>
        <li>Physical parameters: measurable characteristics of water that do not change its chemical composition.
          <ul class="dash-ul">
            <li>
              Temperature: affects dissolved gases and biological activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turbidity: measures water clarity; higher turbidity means dirtier water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Color
            </li>
            <li>
              taste and odor
            </li>
            <li>
              Solids
            </li>
          </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Chemical parameters: about chemical properties of the water.
          <ul class="dash-ul">
            <li>
              pH: acidity or alkalinity, with a neutral pH at 7
            </li>
            <li>
              Dissolved oxygen: crucial for aquatic life; warmer water holds lesse dissolved oxygen
            </li>
            <li>
              Nutrients: such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can indicate pollution levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Total dissolved solids(TDS): the concentration of all dissolved substances in water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chlorine
            </li>

              Hardness

              Biological oxygen demand
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Biological parameters of water. To asses the presence of living organisms in the water.
          <ul class="dash-ul">
            <li>
              Bacteria, such as E. coli, a common indicator of fexal contamination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Algae: can impact dissolved oxygen levels and are a sign of nutrient enrichment
            </li>
            <li>
              Viruses
            </li>
